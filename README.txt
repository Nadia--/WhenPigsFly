**** [When Pigs Fly] ****

This project is aimed at bringing back the Flying Pig mod for Minecraft.

************************
Description
The ultimate goal of the 1.8 Flying Pig mod is to create pigs that fly.  They will be rare creatures with lots of health and will sometimes drop zircon which can be used to make tools, weapons, and armor.  Zircon is superior to diamonds.

************************
Contents
NadiaMod.jar - this is the Flying Pig mod for MC 1.7.
src - this is my current src folder for the Flying Pig mod for MC 1.8. 

************************
Progress
6/3/15 - Zircon tools and weapons added to the game 
6/3/15 - Zircon armor and armor textures added to the game; Layer_1 has not been re-colored properly though.  I'm afraid this funky coloring is also in the MC 1.7 version.
