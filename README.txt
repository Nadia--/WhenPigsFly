**** [When Pigs Fly] ****

This project is aimed at bringing back the Flying Pig mod for Minecraft.

Description
The ultimate goal of the 1.8 Flying Pig mod is to create pigs that fly.  They will be rare creatures with lots of health and will sometimes drop zircon which can be used to make tools, weapons, and armor.  Zircon is superior to diamonds.
